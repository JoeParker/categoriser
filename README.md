# Categoriser

Generates a random category, starts a countdown timer with audio prompts and records rounds. Use with some imagination for local party games. Custom categories can be added and timer settings can be tweaked on the fly.

Now includes beta Imageloader to pull a display image for each category using [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/). Supports any custom category in theory, but image fetch result may not be relevant to category text in specific cases.

Uses pretty-ms: `$ npm install pretty-ms`

Run: `$ npm start`
